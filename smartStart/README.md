# Smart Start 
> Start your login items in a way that they do not slow down you computer.

Delays the start up of login items such that they don't slow down the start up process. One can define the start up delay for every single application. Furthermore you can assign specific flags to a application such that they only start when there is e.g. internet connectivity.

## Installation

macOS:

* Open `run.sh`, enter the correct path to the `main.py` and save it
* Open _System Preferences -> Users & Groups -> Login Items_
* Add the `run.sh` file to the login items by clicking on the <kbd>+</kbd>, navigating the the file and adding it

Alter `applications.json` to start your desired applications.
